# Using this workspace to start practing to become a software engineer.
1/9/2023 
I have setup my visual studio code with extensions and making sure it connects to git. I can also pull and push 
I recently found this website https://teachyourselfcs.com/ so that I can study computer science I have started today and hopefully from now on I will be able to upload files and work to this repository to show my body of work on my way to becoming a software engineer.
